If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     `<mat-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></mat-icon>\n *     <mat-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></mat-icon>`\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the `<mat-icon>`\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MatIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     `<mat-icon>home</mat-icon>\n *     <mat-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</mat-icon>`\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     `<mat-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></mat-icon>`\n */\nvar MatIcon = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(MatIcon, _super);\n    function MatIcon(elementRef, _iconRegistry, ariaHidden) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, elementRef) || this;\n        _this._iconRegistry = _iconRegistry;\n        // If the user has not explicitly set aria-hidden, mark the icon as hidden, as this is\n        // the right thing to do for the majority of icon use-cases.\n        if (!ariaHidden) {\n            elementRef.nativeElement.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');\n        }\n        return _this;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MatIcon.prototype, \"fontSet\", {\n        get: /**\n         * Font set that the icon is a part of.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this._fontSet; },\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (value) {\n            this._fontSet = this._cleanupFontValue(value);\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(MatIcon.prototype, \"fontIcon\", {\n        get: /**\n         * Name of an icon within a font set.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this._fontIcon; },\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (value) {\n            this._fontIcon = this._cleanupFontValue(value);\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.
