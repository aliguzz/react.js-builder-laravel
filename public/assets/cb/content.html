        <p>Welcome to the website of the Cafe on the Corner. We are situated, yes you've guessed it, on the corner of This Road and That Street in The Town.</p>
        <p>We serve freshly brewed tea and coffee, soft drinks and a section of light meals and tasty treats and snacks. We are open for breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea from 8 am to 5 pm and unlike any other cafe in the town, we are open 7 days per week.</p>

        <p>A truly family run business, we aim to create a cosy and friendly atmosphere in the cafe with Mum and Auntie doing the cooking and Dad and the (grown-up) children serving front of house. We look forward to welcoming you to the Cafe on the Corner very soon.</p>
